# ASCII-Art
#### With this program you can print a ascii representation of an image in your terminal
## Usage
##### `python asciiart.py imagePath -<light/dark>`
The 2. argument specifies your terminal background color. This is needed for printing the image correctly.
<br>When the image isn't visible, change your terminal font size to a lower size or lower the image's size.
## Examples
### Before :<br>
   ![Flower](./images/Flower.jpg)
### After  :  
   ![Flower](./images/asciiart_example_flower.png)
    <br> Note: I resized the image and used the -dark argument
## Dependencies
`pip install -r requirements.txt`
